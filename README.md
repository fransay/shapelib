# Geometry :triangular_ruler:  
Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, it concerned with the properties of space such as 
distance, shape, size and relative positioning of figures. A high level classification shall render the field
into two categories. They are euclidean geometry non-euclidean geometry. Euclidean geometry is primarily concerned
with the fundamental notion of points, lines and planes.Non-Euclidean is mostly concerned with the study of surfaces
which are not flat, straight lines are not usual in non-euclidean engagements ...[Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry)

# Fundamental Objects of Geometry
Three fundamental objects of geometry includes point, lines and polygon, points are the most fundamental 
blocks of geometry.
## Point 
A point is a primitive notion that models an exact location in space and has no length, width or thickness.
Points are the basic building blocks of every geometric figure, a point is represented in space by its spatial 
dimensions as (x,y).

### Properties
```
1. No width or thickness 
2. No length
3. No centroid
```

## Line Segment
A line segment is a line defined by two distinct points in space.

### Properties
```
1. Length
2. Midpoint
3. Bearing
```

## Line String  
Line string is a one dimensional contiguous representation of line segments and the sequences of points connecting them.
